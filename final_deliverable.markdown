## Introduction
This project investigates the relationship between students' social behaviors (number of friends, hours spent on social media, extracurricular involvment, etc.) and their academic performance.
We ask:<br>

• Do extroverts tend to perform better in school?<br>
• Is social media or Netflix use associated with worse academic performance?<br>
• Are there relationships between social behavior and GPA/test scores?<br>

Answering these questions and understanding any connections can help guide student wellness, outreach programs, and advising.<br>
